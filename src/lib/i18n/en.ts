      content: `My summer has been productive so far‚Ä¶ I wrote and published my first book!

Plumberella isn't your typical fairytale. It's a witty, heartfelt steampunk story about a brave, inventive girl who creates truth instead of waiting for magic.

This story blends:
‚Ä¢ Clever heroines and critical thinking
‚Ä¢ The magic of invention and courage
‚Ä¢ Empowerment for young readers and dreamers of all ages

I wrote Plumberella for those who believe kindness and cleverness can change the world.`,
      bookExcerpt: `**Chapter 2. Plumberella**

As you already know, Plumberella's birth was overshadowed by tragedy. When the time came to name the newborn, Henry, lost and heartbroken, sought some kind of anchor in the familiar. He looked at the shower in the bathroom, where he had just been soothing the baby, and thought: "Plumberella. Sweet, pure, like my life's true calling to make the world cleaner. I am the Plumber!" And so she was named Plumberella‚Äînot just officially, but also by love.

The girl grew up calm, bright, and kind. As soon as she learned to firmly hold a wrench in her hands, she immediately began helping her father. Sometimes he took her along on jobs‚Äîthankfully, the clients didn't mind, and the girl was quieter than water and very capable.

Sometimes she'd hand him an eight-millimeter wrench, or the wire cutters, or fish out the exact part from the toolbox as if by magic.

By the age of seventeen, Plumberella was already quite proficient in plumbing. Henry proudly considered: maybe it was time to give her her first solo job? Especially since she wasn't just learning from him‚Äîshe was attending the plumbing guild school. Of course, she was the only girl there. Moreover, the youngest: after the entrance exams, she had been allowed to skip two levels right away.

But neither that nor the male-dominated environment fazed her. Plumberella was respected. For her intellect, composure, and directness. Some of the boys were even a little afraid of her: she not only knew the structure of a siphon better than any of them, but she could also snap off a sharp retort if someone started acting rude. The plunger‚Äîin her hands‚Äîwas both a tool and a symbol of justice.

And Plumberella adored reading. Books were like portals for her‚Äîshe could immerse herself in any role: a princess, a scout, a space wizard... But there was no magic in her life. There were pipes, faucets, and work. Still, in rare free hours, you could find her at the library‚Äîamong towers of books and the scent of old paper.

That morning, Dad had left early. And since Plumberella's classes started later, she allowed herself the pleasure of lingering under the blanket, listening to the birds singing outside the window. In the kitchen, warm croissants waited for her‚Äîlovingly left by her father. She ate two and didn't regret it‚Äîthe day promised to be interesting.

While getting ready, she carefully arranged her tools in her pink toolbox‚Äîa gift from her father on her fifteenth birthday. Everything was sorted by color: wrenches‚Äîgreen, screwdrivers‚Äîblue, pliers‚Äîpurple, like her lavender gloves. That made it easier for her to think.

The day at school started briskly. Today's topic was the construction of toilet tanks. Theory was smooth, but a surprise awaited the students during practice. While the teacher was distracted checking notebooks, a few boys from the class decided to play a prank. The water tank of the training toilet was secretly opened, and thick green slime‚Äîbrought from home by one of the students‚Äîwas poured inside.

The teacher, noticing nothing, began his explanation:

"So, dear apprentices, today we will learn how to diagnose faults in the flushing mechanism. One of you assembled the training setup yesterday. Let's see. I press the button‚Äîand‚Ä¶"`,

      excerpt: "The latest updates from the AI frontier: fraud-busting bots, Netflix's VFX revolution, and teens' new digital confidants.",
      content: `**1. Fraud-busting‚ÄîAI style!**
OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, just rang the alarm about an "AI fraud crisis." Voice-mimicking bots can replicate your voice so convincingly that even voice-auth systems are shaky. The fix? Rethinking how we verify identity‚Äîfrom voice to maybe mood, gesture, or time-based codes!
‚öôÔ∏è Fun twist: Imagine your AI guard-duck that quacks a secret code before unlocking your vault. ü¶Ü

**2. Netflix goes post-apoc‚Äîwith style!**
Netflix dropped the first on‚Äëscreen VFX scene in *El Eternauta* using generative AI. A collapsing building generated *10√ó faster* (and cheaper!) than traditional VFX. The future of film is looking like "cheap and breathtaking."

**3. Teens tell AI secrets**
A new survey shows teens are spilling life questions to AI chatbots‚Äîfrom friendship dilemmas to career pep talks. One Kansas student said, "Everyone uses AI for everything now‚Ä¶ to get out of thinking." AI: the ultimate teenage BFF? Or just procrastination gone digital?

**4. Steam's game-changer: GenAI everywhere**
Gaming is getting an AI makeover! On Steam, 20% of new titles in 2025 use GenAI‚Äîmostly for visuals, audio, and even in-game storytelling. AI Roguelite is leading the pack, generating content as you play!

**5. AI goes global (and political)**
President Trump's new "AI Action Plan" aims to turbocharge data centre builds, export US AI tech globally, and strip AI bias. Critics worry it's tech-first, safety-later. Meanwhile, the White House drafts an order on "woke AI" neutrality. Politics meets processors!

üîß **Quick Takeaways**

‚öôÔ∏è Guard your voice‚Äîit's the new password.
‚öôÔ∏è Hollywood's special effects toolkit just hit fast-forward.
‚öôÔ∏è Teens chatting with bots could reshape future social norms.
‚öôÔ∏è Video games now speak AI‚Äîin real time.
‚öôÔ∏è AI is now boardroom and ballot-box level.

That's your snapshot of the AI frontier! Want illustrational memes, poll ideas, or cheeky call‚Äëout questions in the next post? Just say the word.

**Next post drops in 2 days**‚Äîstay tuned! üöÄ`
